# ECE6122-Adv-Prog-Tech
This is the repository of courseworks of ECE6122@Gatech.

Six topics are covered:

1. Under MPI_2D_FFT:  Use MPI(message passing interface) to implement the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm for 2D pictures.

2. Under pThreads_2D_FFT:  Use pThreads(a multi-threads library) to implement Fast Fourier Transform algorithm for 2D pictures.

3. Under TemplatedVector:  Manually implement templated vector class in C++. --I re-invent the wheel

4. Under RSA_Encrypt_Decrypt:  Implement the RSA encryption algorithm and try to break it.

5. Under OpenGL_Icosahedron:  Draw Icosahedron with OpenGL. Colors and surface subdivision are applied.

6. Under OpenGL_MBSet_pThreads:  Calculate the Mandelbrot set with 16 threads. Draw the figure of Mandelbrot set with OpenGL. Zoom in and zoom out are implemented. Implementation of Nvidia CUDA in calculating is under construction.

It is better to run all these .cc under Linux environment.
* Dependencies are not included in this repository.
